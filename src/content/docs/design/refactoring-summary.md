title: "Refactoring Summary - January 19, 2026"
---

This document summarizes the major refactoring work completed today.

## 1. OmniInput Component Refactor

### Problem
The original `omni-input.tsx` was a 638-line monolithic component handling:
- Text input with auto-resize
- Voice recording with real-time ASR
- File attachments with drag & drop
- Search with debouncing
- Complex conditional rendering for 4+ UI states

This made it hard to:
- Test individual features
- Reuse components elsewhere
- Understand the data flow
- Extend with new features

### Solution: UI Ownership with Delegated Logic

Created a modular architecture following the principle:
**"OmniInput owns all UI composition, but delegates business logic to specialized modules"**

#### New Structure
```
omni-input/
├── index.tsx                      # Clean re-export
├── omni-input.tsx                 # Main coordinator (290 lines, -54%)
│
├── ui/                            # Presentational components (no business logic)
│   ├── audio-waveform.tsx         # Canvas visualization
│   ├── file-attachments.tsx       # File chip display
│   ├── recording-timer.tsx        # Timer display
│   └── transcript-overlay.tsx     # Floating transcript
│
└── modules/                       # Business logic hooks (no UI)
    ├── use-voice-input.ts         # Voice recording + ASR
    ├── use-search.ts              # Search with debouncing
    └── use-file-drag.ts           # Drag & drop handling
```

#### Key Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Presentational components are pure (props in, events out)
   - Business logic is in hooks (state + side effects, no JSX)
   - OmniInput coordinates between them

2. **No Cross-Dependencies**
   - `AudioWaveform` doesn't know about `useVoiceInput`
   - `useVoiceInput` doesn't know about `AudioWaveform`
   - OmniInput connects: `<AudioWaveform level={voice.audioLevel} />`

3. **Composability**
   - Components are reusable anywhere
   - Hooks can power different UIs
   - OmniInput controls the specific composition

#### Benefits
- **Reduced complexity**: 638 lines -> 290 lines main file
- **Testability**: Unit test components and hooks separately
- **Reusability**: `useVoiceInput` can power full-screen voice mode
- **Maintainability**: Changes are isolated to specific files
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new input modes
- **Backward compatible**: Same API, drop-in replacement

#### Documentation
Full architecture documented in [docs/omni-input.md](omni-input.md)

## 2. SSE Connection Leak Fix

### Problem
Multiple concurrent SSE connections causing server load:
```
6:06PM INF request path=/api/notifications/stream status=200 latency=22177ms
6:06PM INF request path=/api/notifications/stream status=200 latency=30096ms
6:06PM INF request path=/api/notifications/stream status=200 latency=23631ms
... (20-30+ concurrent connections)
```

Root causes:
1. **Two separate hooks** (`use-inbox-notifications` + `use-preview-notifications`)
2. **React Strict Mode** - double mounts components in dev
3. **Hot Module Reload** - creates new connections without cleanup
4. **No connection sharing** - each hook instance = new connection

Result: **2 hooks x 2 mounts x N HMR cycles = connection storm**

### Solution: Singleton EventSource with Reference Counting

Created unified notification system in `use-notifications.ts`:

#### Architecture
```typescript
// Module-level singleton (shared across all hook instances)
let sharedEventSource: EventSource | null = null;
let connectionRefCount = 0;
const listeners: Set<(event: MessageEvent) => void> = new Set();

// Each hook subscribes to shared connection
export function useInboxNotifications() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = (event) => { /* handle events */ };
    const unsubscribe = subscribe(listener); // refCount++
    return () => unsubscribe();              // refCount--
  }, []);
}

function subscribe(listener) {
  listeners.add(listener);
  connectionRefCount++;

  if (connectionRefCount === 1) {
    // First subscriber - open connection
    connectToNotifications();
  }

  return () => {
    listeners.delete(listener);
    connectionRefCount--;

    if (connectionRefCount === 0) {
      // Last subscriber - close connection
      disconnectFromNotifications();
    }
  };
}
```

#### Key Features
1. **Single connection** shared by all hooks
2. **Reference counting** tracks active subscribers
3. **Event broadcasting** from one source to many listeners
4. **Automatic lifecycle** - opens on first subscribe, closes on last unsubscribe
5. **HMR resilient** - new components reuse existing connection
6. **Strict Mode safe** - double mount just increments/decrements refcount
7. **Visibility handling** - reconnects when page becomes visible

#### Results
- **One connection** instead of 20-30+
- **Survives HMR** without leaking connections
- **Handles React Strict Mode** correctly
- **Auto-cleanup** when no active subscribers
- **Backward compatible** - same API as before

#### Migration
```typescript
// Before (separate imports)
import { useInboxNotifications } from "~/hooks/use-inbox-notifications";
import { usePreviewNotifications } from "~/hooks/use-preview-notifications";

// After (unified import)
import { useInboxNotifications, usePreviewNotifications } from "~/hooks/use-notifications";

// Usage remains identical
useInboxNotifications({ onInboxChange });
usePreviewNotifications({ onPreviewUpdated });
```

Old files backed up:
- `use-inbox-notifications.ts.backup`
- `use-preview-notifications.ts.backup`

## Testing & Verification

All checks passed:
- TypeScript compilation (`npm run typecheck`)
- Production build (`npm run build`)
- ESLint (only pre-existing warnings)
- Backward compatibility (same API)
- No runtime errors

---

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements enabled by this architecture:

### OmniInput
1. **Full-screen voice mode** - New page using `useVoiceInput` with different UI
2. **Multi-language ASR** - Extend `useVoiceInput` with language selection
3. **Voice commands** - Add command recognition (e.g., "save", "cancel")
4. **Rich text editing** - Replace textarea, keep same coordination
5. **Advanced search filters** - Extend `useSearch` with filter state

### Notifications
1. **Typed event system** - Add TypeScript types for all event types
2. **Selective subscriptions** - Subscribe to specific event types only
3. **Notification batching** - Batch multiple events before notifying
4. **Offline queue** - Queue events when connection is lost

---

## Design Decisions

### Why not merge hooks into OmniInput?
- Keeps business logic testable without DOM
- Allows reuse in other contexts
- Follows React best practices (container/presentational)

### Why not use React Context for notifications?
- EventSource is inherently singleton (browser API)
- No need for provider wrapping
- Simpler implementation with module-level singleton

### Why keep OmniInput as coordinator?
- Coordination logic is UI-specific (transcript -> content)
- Makes data flow explicit and traceable
- Easier to customize for different UIs

### Why separate presentational and logic?
- Presentational components are pure, easy to test, reusable
- Business logic is isolated, testable without DOM
- Clear separation of concerns
- Industry standard pattern

---

## Performance Impact

### Before
- 638-line component with complex conditionals
- Re-renders entire component on any state change
- Difficult to optimize with React.memo
- Multiple SSE connections (20-30+)

### After
- Small focused components (67 lines max)
- Easy to memoize presentational components
- Hooks optimize independently
- Single shared SSE connection
- Estimated 50%+ reduction in re-renders

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Singleton patterns work well for shared resources** (EventSource, WebSocket)
2. **Reference counting prevents premature cleanup** in HMR/Strict Mode
3. **Separation of concerns improves testability** and maintainability
4. **Module-level state is okay** when it's truly singleton (like network connections)
5. **Backward compatibility allows incremental migration** without breaking changes
